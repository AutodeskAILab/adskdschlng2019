You can download this from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_C1uVoG1ZGF3pfDpHFKIS8Qqd2VXLZQ/view). This is an unlabelled dataset of mostly digital 3D shapes designed directly by people in CAD software mostly to be used for 3D printing. You can read more about it [here](https://www.groundai.com/project/thingi10k-a-dataset-of-10000-3d-printing-models/2) but keep in mind that we are not using the original dataset but the version that is re-meshed by [TetWild](https://github.com/Yixin-Hu/TetWild) with surface mesh extracted. So, some of the meshes might have less problems compared to what is described there and some meshes might have other problems that is not mentioned there! This dataset provides less noisy data and a good aesthetic and stylistic diversity.\n",

The filenames specify the type of the chess piece and the set they belong to. The meshes are generated by scanning actual chess pieces and therefor the meshes are of higher resolution but a bit noisier compared to the Thingi10k dataset.

    "## Main Challenge\n",
    "The main point of the challenge is to provide designers with useful insights about stylistic and aesthetic features of a shape in the context of another shape or set of shapes. Assume we have one (or a set of) meshes with a certain desired style and aesthetics (like a set of chess pieces that go together). Now assume a designer is working on the design of a new chess piece and likes to know if parts of her design don’t match the style and aesthetics of the rest of the chess set. The insights can be, for example, in the form of visualisation of regions of a mesh that are not similar to any region of another mesh (or set of meshes) with red colour (representing undesired local forms and features), and regions that are very similar to some regions of the other mesh(s) in blue. The designer can quickly know which part of her design require editing.\n",

    "In the above figure, if we compare the larger complex shape (on the top-right) with the smaller simpler shape (on the bottom-left), we see that almost all the local regions on the larger shape are more or less similar to at least one region in smaller shape. Except for the fillets on the bottom edges of the pockets that have no counterparts in the smaller shape. This is shown with red regions (high dissimilarity) vs dark blue regions (low dissimilarity) in the example visualization below. A designer looking at this visualization can tell right away, which parts of her design do not match with the style of the smaller shape. This is the type of visualization we expect in this challenge.\n",

Selecting the right properties and relations that are less dependent on the meshing and the size and global shape of the mesh and more dependent on the local style and aesthetic of that region of the mesh will help you filter out the irrelevant data and capture the signal you are interested in.\n",

    "Also, as you analyse the meshes looking for the signals relevant to the local style of the shapes you will find that the style of the shapes and mesh patches don't change if you look at them from different angles, that is to rotate them along the vertical (z) axis. You are not required to take into account this invariance, although you can. However, if you turn them upside down (rotate them along x and/or y axis), the style of the local patches will be affected. For example, think about a set of chess pieces that all have some sort of cylindrical style (as shown in the following figure). If you rotate one of the pieces 90 degree along x axis, the patch styles of this piece will change and instead match with a different chess set that has flat regions in the front and back and curves on the top, bottom, and the sides. So, you can use this knowledge about the effect of orientation, particularly the sense of up/down for the shapes, to your advantage. Basically, we recommend not to rotate the meshes and compare their patches in their original orientations from the datasets.\n",

You need to focus on the variance in the data that comes from stylistics and aesthetic properties of a mesh patch (signal) versus other variances due to general shape and size of the object and the mesh (noise). The labels in the Thingi10k dataset might be helpful to inspire you or provide useful signals for this step. Be careful though. Unfortunately, the chess dataset is from a 3D scanner (not CAD) and a bit noisy. That’s data scientists’ life! You might want to use a deep neural network or other ML techniques to generate a latent vector (patch style embedding) from each patch that somehow represent the stylistic and aesthetic properties of that patch or just a dimensionality reduction or even use the feature vector directly if you believe it has a good style signal and very low noise and irrelevant variance. At the end of this stage you must have a piece of code that outputs that style embedding for an input patch data (coming from any one of the meshes in the Thingi10k dataset)."
